  "description": "ABOUT THIS TEMPLATEThis workflow creates high-quality, text-rich advertising banners from simpleLINE messages.It combines Google Gemini (for marketing-focused prompt engineering) and NanoBanana Pro (accessed via Kie.ai [http://Kie.ai] API) to generate images withsuperior text rendering capabilities. It also handles the asynchronous APIpolling required for high-quality image generation.HOW IT WORKS 1. Input: Users send a banner concept via LINE (e.g., \"Coffee brand, morning vibe\"). 2. Prompt Engineering: Gemini optimizes the request into a detailed prompt, specifying lighting, composition, and Japanese catch-copy placement. 3. Async Generation: The workflow submits a job to Nano Banana Pro (Kie API) and intelligently waits/polls until the image is ready. 4. Hosting: The final image is downloaded and uploaded to a public AWS S3 bucket. 5. Delivery: The image is pushed back to the user on LINE.WHO IT’S FOR * Marketing teams creating A/B test assets. * Japanese market advertisers needing accurate text rendering. * Developers looking for an example of Async API Polling patterns in n8n.REQUIREMENTS * n8n (Cloud or Self-hosted). * Kie.ai [http://Kie.ai] API Key (for Nano Banana Pro model). * Google Gemini API Key. * AWS S3 Bucket (Public access enabled). * LINE Official Account (Messaging API).SETUP STEPS 1. Credentials: Configure the \"Header Auth\" credential for the Kie.ai [http://Kie.ai] nodes (Header: Authorization, Value: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY). 2. AWS: Ensure your S3 bucket allows public read access so LINE can display the image. 3. Webhook: Add the production webhook URL to your LINE Developers console.",
